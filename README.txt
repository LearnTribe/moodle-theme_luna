Luna is a fluid-width 2 column theme based on Binarius, for Moodle 2.4. It is part of a series of ten 'Planet' themes intended to provide a choice of visually accessible and/or fun colour schemes.

Luna is designed to provide a reduced contrast simple interface. It also includes a 2.4 compatible version of the MoodleBar developed by Lewis Carr, and uses the autohide functionality for course editing buttons outlined by Frankie Kam.

Yes, I know that Luna (the Moon) isn't a planet - but it fits this set of solar-bodied themes and exerts influence on the Earth. Hopefully Moon lovers will find this theme aesthetically pleasing.
